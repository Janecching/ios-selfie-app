- **Story:** Users choose a silhoeutte, poses according to the sihoulette, and camera automatically snaps a self when user gets into the silhouette.
- **Market:** Any individual who wants to take better selfies, especially solo travellers, content creators.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often as user takes selfies.
